# python-projects

Here you'll find python projects that I have completed for CS 303E Elements of Computing and CS 313E Elements of Software Design.
What fascinated me about the Elements of Computing Program was that the objective was not to learn how to program, but instead to learn how to solve systemic problems effectively. The projects ranged from analyzing the extensive vocabulary of profound literary figures, such as Charles Dickens, to simulating a game of poker by using object-oriented programming.

### CS 303E Elements of Computing - Dr. Shyamal Mitra
This was an introductory computer science course. We covered basic computer architecture and software components, while also learning how to program in Python, a high level language.
We learned problem solving techniques for numerical and scientific problems, studied some special features of Python, developed our own algorithms, and translated these algorithms to computer code.


### CS 313E Elements of Software Design - Dr. Shyamal Mitra
This course is the continuation of CS 303E. The emphasis was on software development using object-oriented methodology.
We learned how to anlayze and design software, while also learning how to create reusable software components. We learned to 
compose programs from already available components. Further, we studied some basic data structures and algorithms, and learned how to match the data structures and algorithms
to interesting problems. We also tested and evaluated programs for their functionality and their performance.
