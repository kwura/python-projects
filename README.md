# python-projects

Here you'll find python projects during my undergraduate computer science coursework. During this time I became fascinated with the material as the objective was not to learn how to program, but instead to learn how to solve systemic problems effectively. The projects ranged from analyzing the extensive vocabulary of profound literary figures, such as Charles Dickens, to simulating a game of poker by using object-oriented programming.

If you have any questions about my programs or would like further detail of the projects please feel free to message me. 

### Foundations of Programming
The projects under this folder were completed during my first introductory computer science course. I covered basic computer architecture and software components, while also learning how to program in Python.
I learned problem solving techniques for numerical and scientific problems, studied some special features of Python, developed our own algorithms, and translated these algorithms to computer code.


### Object-oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms
The projects under this folder emphasized software development using object-oriented methodology.
I learned how to anlayze and design software, while also learning how to create reusable software components. I learned to 
compose programs from already available components. Further, we studied some basic data structures and algorithms, and learned how to match the data structures and algorithms
to interesting problems. I also tested and evaluated programs for their functionality and their performance.
